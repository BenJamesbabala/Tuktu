Example Configurations in Tuktu Using the Modeller
=========

Some example configurations are shown and outlined in the [examples readme](examples.md). While it is useful to learn how the configuration system of Tuktu works, most often you will not be dealing with this sort of flow consturction and rather use the modeller instead. Here we discuss how the modeller actually works, we will do so by using the same examples as outlined in the [examples readme](examples.md).
