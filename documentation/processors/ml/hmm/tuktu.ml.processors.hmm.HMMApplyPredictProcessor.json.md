### tuktu.ml.processors.hmm.HMMApplyPredictProcessor
Applies a hidden markov model to generate the most likely observable state sequence.

  * **id** *(type: string)* `[Required]`

  * **result** *(type: string)* `[Required]`

  * **config** *(type: object)* `[Required]`

    * **model_name** *(type: string)* `[Required]`

    * **destroy_on_eof** *(type: boolean)* `[Optional, default = true]`
    - Will this model be cleaned up once EOF is reached.

    * **steps** *(type: int)* `[Required]`
